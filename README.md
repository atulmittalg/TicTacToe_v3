## Purpose

Finding out the result of the classic game Tic-tac-toe using JAVA when a given set of inputs are given for 2 players playing the game.

## Approach

Using JAVA as the base and  Maven to handle the dependencies, following the approach of TDD to achieve the solution, by creating test cases and developing accordingly to pass the test.

## Rules of Tic-Tac-Toe

    - X always goes first.
	- Players cannot play on a played position.
	- Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:
      	○ One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
      	○ All nine squares are filled.
	- If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.
	- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
